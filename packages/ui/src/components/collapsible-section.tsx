 * section the user has closed. Everything else is delegated, not reimplemented.
 *
 * Sections are independent — opening one never closes another.

        `border-t` draws the line between the title row and its content — the trigger row
        has no border of its own, so this is the only seam that can carry it.
        `pt-3` (not `pt-0`) exists because `Input`'s floating label straddles the top edge
        of the control (`top-0 -translate-y-1/2`, so roughly half its own height sits above
        that edge by design). `AccordionContent`'s wrapper is `overflow-hidden` — required
        for the open/close height animation — so with no top clearance the label's overshoot
        was clipped for any field placed first inside a section. This padding is what gives
        it room; it is not decorative spacing.
